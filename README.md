# RelativeGradingTool
A Relative Grading App is a software solution designed to assess studentsâ€™ performance based on the relative grading system. Unlike absolute grading (where grades are assigned based on fixed cutoffs), relative grading evaluates students by comparing their scores with the overall performance of the class.
